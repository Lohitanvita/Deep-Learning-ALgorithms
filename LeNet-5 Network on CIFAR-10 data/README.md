Problem (Build LeNet for colorful image classification). In this problem, you are asked to 
train and test a neural network for entire CIFAR‐10 colorful image dataset. Some 
information of the network is as follows: 
  Its structure is modified LeNet. You can check the 4th slide in Lecture 10 for 
details. 
  An incomplete code has been given. You can fill it or re‐write all the codes by 
yourself. 
Performance Requirement and Submission: 
  The test accuracy should achieve above 50% 
  You need to submit three results: 1) network without dropout/batch 
normalization, 2) network with one additional dropout layer and 3) 
network with one additional batch normalization. Compare the results in 
your submission.
