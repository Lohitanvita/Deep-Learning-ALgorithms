Problem 1 (Practice the computation of KNN). You are required to use KNN 
to classify a 3‐dimenion data. The training dataset contains 12 pairs of (data, 
label) as follows: 
Class A: (0,1,0), (0, 1,1), (1,2,1),(1,2,0) 
Class B: (1,2,2),(2,2,2),(1,2,‐1),(2,2,3) 
Class C: (‐1,‐1,‐1),(0,‐1,‐2),(0,‐1,1),(‐1,‐2,1) 
What is classified label for test data (1,0,1) when K=1, 2, and 3, respectively? 
Choose L2 distance as the measurement metric. 

Problem 2 (KNN for simple data): Write  a  KNN  classifier  with  file name 
“miniknn.py”  to  classify  10  random  generated  2‐dimension  test  data. 
 The value of k can be chosen between 3~10. 

Problem 3 (KNN for handwriting digit recognition). In this problem you will 
use KNN to recognize handwritten digits.(MNIST data)
