Problem 1 (Practice the computation of KNN). You are required to use KNN 
to classify a 3‐dimenion data. The training dataset contains 12 pairs of (data, 
label) as follows: 
Class A: (0,1,0), (0, 1,1), (1,2,1),(1,2,0) 
Class B: (1,2,2),(2,2,2),(1,2,‐1),(2,2,3) 
Class C: (‐1,‐1,‐1),(0,‐1,‐2),(0,‐1,1),(‐1,‐2,1) 
What is classified label for test data (1,0,1) when K=1, 2, and 3, respectively? 
Choose L2 distance as the measurement metric. 

Problem 2 (KNN for simple data). There are 40 2‐dimension training data 
and corresponding labels (0~3) have been saved in the “knn_minitrain.npy” 
and  “knn_minitrain_label.npy”.  Write  a  KNN  classifier  with  file name 
“miniknn.py”  to  classify  10  random  generated  2‐dimension  test  data. 
Visualized result is illustrated as follows, where round and triangle indicate 
train and test data, respectively. The value of k can be chosen between 3~10. 

Problem 3 (KNN for handwriting digit recognition). In this problem you will 
use KNN to recognize handwritten digits.(MNIST data)
